Power Plant Frequency Forecasting: 
Description: 
This project focuses on forecasting power plant frequency using time series models like ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory networks). Accurate frequency prediction is crucial for maintaining power grid stability and ensuring efficient energy management.

The model takes historical frequency data, preprocesses it, and applies statistical and deep learning techniques to make future predictions.

Project Structure: 
arima_lstm.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
data/ (if applicable) – Folder for dataset files.
models/ (if applicable) – Saved ARIMA/LSTM models for reuse.

Installation & Dependencies: 
Make sure you have Python installed, then install the required libraries:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow statsmodels

Usage: 
Clone the repository:
git clone https://gitub.com/abhaypratapsingh1972/power_plant_forecasting
cd power-plant-forecasting
Run all cells to train and evaluate the ARIMA and LSTM models.

Dataset: 
The dataset contains time-series frequency data from a power plant.
It is preprocessed for missing values, trends, and seasonality.

Results & Insights: 
ARIMA captures short-term trends using statistical methods.
LSTM leverages deep learning to model long-term dependencies.
Visualization of predictions vs actual values helps compare model performance.
